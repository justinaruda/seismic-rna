DMS-MaPseq
========================================================================

Dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) is a
method for determining the base pairing status of adenosine and cytidine
nucleotides in an RNA molecule, towards solving its overall secondary or
tertiary structure. DMS-MaPseq was invented by `Zubradt et al. (2017)`_
and further developed in subsequent works:

- `DÃ¼lk and Rouskin (2022)`_<https://dx.doi.org/10.3791/64820>
- `Bohn et al. (2023)`_<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01862-7>
