Edge cases handling
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Index Tolerence:

    giving a index tolerence on index too close to the start or end of the sequence will result in a error if not handled. 
    This currently is handled by taking the value that would go below zero and instead adding it to the oppostie side of the index tolerence

How are they handled?]
