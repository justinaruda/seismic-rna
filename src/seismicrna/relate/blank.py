    Return blank relation vector(s) of a given length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bases: int | DNA
        The reference sequence (if DNA) or just its length (if int).
        If the sequence itself is given, then return a Series/DataFrame
        whose main index (index for Series, columns for DataFrame) is a
        MultiIndex of 1-indexed positions and bases in the sequence.
        If only the sequence length is given, then return a NumPy array.
    reads: int | list | np.ndarray | pd.Index | None = None
        Optional names of the relation vectors. If given, then return a
        DataFrame whose indexes are the read names if bases is DNA,
        otherwise a 2D NumPy array with one row for each name in reads.
        If None, then return a Series if bases is DNA, otherwise a 1D
        NumPy array.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray | pd.Series | pd.DataFrame
        The blank relation vector(s).
