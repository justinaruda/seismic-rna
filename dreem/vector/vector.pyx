    Base class for an Insertion or Deletion (collectively, "indel")

    It is used to find alternative positions for indels by keeping track
    of an indel's current coordinates (as it is moved) and determining
    whether a specific move is valid.

    Arguments
    ---------
    rel_ins_idx: int
        The 0-indexed position of the indel with respect to the sequence
        (ref or read) with the relative insertion. This position points
        to one specific base. If the mutation is labeled an insertion,
        then the read is the sequence with the relative insertion (since
        it has a base that is not in the reference), and rel_ins_idx is
        the 0-based index of the inserted base in the coordinates of the
        read sequence. If the mutation is labeled a deletion, then the
        reference is the sequence with the relative insertion (since it
        has a base that is not in the read), and rel_ins_idx is the
        0-based index of the deleted base in the coordinates of the
        reference sequence.
    rel_del_idx (int):  The opposite of rel_ins_idx: the 0-indexed position
                        of the indel with respect to the sequence with a
                        relative deletion (that is, the read if the mutation
                        is denoted a deletion, and the ref if an insertion).
                        Because the deleted base does not actually exist
                        within the sequence whose coordinates it is based on,
                        rel_del_idx does not refer to a specific position in
                        the sequence, but instead to the two extant positions
                        in the sequence that flank the deleted position.
                        It is most convenient for the algorithm to have this
                        argument refer to the position 3' of the deleted base
                        and define the 5' position as a property.
