    """
    Calculate the mutation rate at each position in a mutational profile
    for one or more clusters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    refbits: DataDrame
        Reference bits: each index (i) is the name of a read, each
        column (j) a position in the profile, and each value (i, j) a
        boolean where True means that position (j) of read (i) matches
        the reference sequence and False means that it does not.
    mutbits: DataDrame
        Mutated bits: each index (i) is the name of a read, each column
        (j) a position in the profile, and each value (i, j) a boolean
        where True means that position (j) of read (i) is mutated and
        False means that it is not.
    members: DataFrame
        Cluster membership: each index (i) is the name of a read, each
        column (k) the name of a cluster, and each value (i, k) the
        likelihood that read (i) came from cluster (k). Any read absent
        from members is ignored when calculating mutations.
    min_dist: int
        Minimum distance between mutations. This parameter is used to
        correct the bias in observed mutation rates that is caused by
        dropout of reads with nearby mutations, but NOT to remove any
        rows of mutbits or refbits with nearby mutations. Instead, the
        'members' parameter is responsible for filtering such vectors,
        because it comes from the clustering step in which vectors with
        nearby mutations were already removed.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        Mutation rates: each index (j) is a position in the profile,
        each column (k) the name of a cluster, and each value (j, k)
        the mutation fraction at position (j) in cluster (k).
